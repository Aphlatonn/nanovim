			-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
			--
			-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
			-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
			-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
			-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
			--
			-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
			--  - Go to definition
			--  - Find references
			--  - Autocompletion
			--  - Symbol Search
			--  - and more!
			--
			-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
			-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
			--
			-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
			-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

			--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
			--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
			--    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
			--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
	-- { import = "rick" },
